                        <p>Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. 
                            One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p>
                            One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling. 
                            And while they were walking, a little girl came into the house. This little girl had golden curls that tumbled down 
                            her back to her waist, and everyone called her by Goldilocks.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <p>
                            Goldilocks went inside. First she tasted the porridge of the great, huge bear, and that was far too hot for her. 
                            And then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear, and that was too cold for her. 
                            And then she went to the porridge of the little, small wee bear, and tasted that. 
                            And that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate it all up.
